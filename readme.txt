Rube-oid: The Rubik’s Cube-oid generator and solver

This program provides the users with the ability to generate rubik’s cubes or rubik’s cuboids of different dimensions. Then they can rotate the cube either themselves of tell the computer to do it for them. They can also solve the constructed rubik’s cube-oids, either themselves, or with the help of the computer. Visual python aids in allowing the users to view the 3D cube from all possible directions and allows the users to visualize the rotations of the cubes/cuboids.
